        DESCRIPTION
        <h2>
            <pre>
The Lord of the Rings is about a hobbit named Frodo 
Baggins who inherits a powerful, evil ring and embarks
on a perilous quest with a diverse fellowship to 
destroy it in the fires of Mount Doom, the place it
was forged, to prevent the Dark Lord Sauron from 
conquering Middle-earth. The story follows Frodo 
and his loyal friend Sam, alongside the larger
Fellowship (wizards, elves, dwarves, men, and 
other hobbits), as they battle Sauron's forces 
and struggle with the Ring's corrupting influence, 
uniting peoples against a common dark power.  
Core Plot
The Ring: The One Ring, created by Sauron, holds immense
 power and seeks to return to its master; it corrupts its
  bearers. 
The Quest: Frodo must take the Ring to Mordor to cast it 
into the fires of Mount Doom, the only place it can be
 unmade, before Sauron reclaims it. 
The Fellowship: A group forms to aid Frodo, including 
Gandalf (wizard), Aragorn (heir to a throne), Legolas 
(elf), Gimli (dwarf), Boromir (man), Merry, Pippin,
 and Sam (hobbits). 
The War: While Frodo journeys, the rest of the Fellowship
 fights to distract Sauron and rally the free peoples of
  Middle-earth in the War of the Ring. 
Key Themes
Good vs. Evil: A classic struggle against overwhelming 
darkness, focusing on courage and sacrifice. 
Friendship & Loyalty: Deep bonds, particularly between 
Frodo and Sam, are crucial to the quest's success. 
The Corrupting Nature of Power: The Ring's allure and how 
it tests even the best intentions. 
Heroism: Explores different types of heroes, from great 
kings to humble hobbits, and the idea that even small 
individuals can change the world.
